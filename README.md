# Purpose
Eliminating recommendations, shorts and side ads to reduce distractions and focus on essentials.

# Description
Websites like Youtube can be productive. But, as soon the main page loads there are lots of recommendations, shorts and side ads. I aim to reduce distractions for people with ADHD also for others who want to get their work and research done faster. Subscriptions won't be affected.
